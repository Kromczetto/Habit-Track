# Habit Track

## Overview
Habit Track is an iOS application designed to help users build, prioritize, and maintain positive routines. Each habit is assigned a numerical value representing its priority. At the end of each day, completed habits are summed into a daily score that reflects how effectively the user focused on their most important goals.

The app goes beyond basic habit tracking by offering reminders, goal setting, and detailed statistics to support consistency and motivation over time.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete habits  
- Assign a priority score to each habit

## Why Habit Track?
